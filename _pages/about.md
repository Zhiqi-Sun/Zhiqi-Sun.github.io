I was admitted to School of Gifted Young, USTC at fall 2022. In the freshman year, I found myself interested in mathematics, especially in algebra geometry and number theory. 

I joined the Hua Loo-Keng Talent Program in Mathematics when I was admitted to USTC. And I focused more on the learning in Algebra.
